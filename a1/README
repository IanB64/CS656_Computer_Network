Files: 
	1. Files server.py and client.py are Python scripts to create a simple server-client chatroom program. Using basic socket programming, sending and receiving TCP and UDP packets.
	2. There is no Makefile since the program is written in Python
	3. server.sh and client.sh are shell scripts provided and modified according to my choice of programming language (Python). They will be executed and which will then call the server and client programs. 

Compile:
	1. Since the programs are written in Python, there is no need to compile them.

Execute:
To run the server, execute command: ./server.sh <req_code>
To run the client, execute command: ./client.sh <server_address> <n_port> <req_code> <msg>

Parameters:
<req_code>			A numerical validation code.
<server_address>	The name/IP of the machine that the server is running on.
<n_port> 	  		The negotiate port printed out by the server on init
<msg> 		  		The input message to the server.
Note: "TERMINATE" as a <msg> input would shutdown the server.

Environments:
The program is ran and tested in cmd on a Windows10 machine, and ubuntu1804-004, ubuntu1904-008 machines on the Linux student environment at University of Waterloo.
